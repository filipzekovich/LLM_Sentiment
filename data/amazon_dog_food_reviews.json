The ingredients are so much better than a lot of other dog food and I feel good about serving this to a part of the family."

      "text": "I bought into the marketing hype about how I'm a better dog mom for buying this food. My girl ate it over the course of 8-10 months. There were many times when I'd put it in her bowl and she'd look up at me as if to say, \"Ugh, isn't there anything else?\" This is a dog who will eat carrots, kale, rabbit poop, dog poop...so I know she's not picky. ðŸ˜† All the more reason to investigate when she doesn't like the taste of something.After keeping a poop journal ( because yes, I'm THAT dog mom and also poop tell us what's going on in the body) I realized that her poops were always progressively runny as the day went on. Every. Single. Day. We feed 3x a day and she poops about 3 or 4x per day. I always clean it up, so yeah...I notice the subtle changes in the consistency. The only poop that was 100% solid was the first one of the day. Then it would get softer and softer until it was so runny that we'd go on walks and I couldn't even bag it. Also, she's a long-haired breed, so THAT's been a joy to deal with. ðŸ¤® ðŸ¤® ðŸ¤®I switched to another brand...Wellness https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BORBHO...and holy ðŸ’©, ALL of her poops are ALL NORMAL. She also loves the taste of her new food. I love being able to pick it up after it comes out the other end. I love that I don't have to wash her entire back end after an especially messy poop. I will never buy anything from Blue Buffalo again."

This brand has gone down hill and the quality isn't what it used to be especially considering the price you're paying for the quality. For the last few weeks, my dog has been sick from her food. We tried a new package of the same food and she's still sick. Tried a different food and now she's like a completely different dog. Something isn't right here with this food and I would not recommend it for any loving pet owner. If you're looking for a good dog food, look elsewhere."
